# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains my learning journey through small Machine Learning projects using Python and Scikit-learn.  

## Projects

### 1. Salary Prediction (Linear Regression)
- **Dataset:** [Salary Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)  
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)  
- **Result:** Achieved good prediction accuracy with RÂ² score.  
- **Visualization:** Scatter plot of actual vs predicted salaries.  
- **Code:** [view on github ](https://github.com/bhavani-priya880/machine-learning-mini-projects/blob/main/ML_py.ipynb)

### 2. Spam Email Detector (Naive Bayes)
- **Dataset:** Coming soon  
- **Algorithm:** Naive Bayes
